# Awilix DI Implementation Status Report

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ What's Working

1. **Awilix Container Setup**
   - Container initialization successful
   - Dependencies properly registered
   - Type-safe dependency resolution working

2. **Actor Registration**
   - AggregateActor successfully registered with Dapr
   - Actor class properly created with all methods
   - Awilix DI integrated into actor constructor

3. **Server Startup**
   - Express server starts successfully
   - Dapr integration initialized
   - All routes properly configured

4. **Dependency Injection**
   - `getDaprCradle()` successfully retrieves dependencies
   - AggregateActorImpl receives all required dependencies
   - No more ActorDependencies singleton pattern

### ‚ùå What Needs Fixing

1. **Timer Registration Issue**
   - Actor timer registration causes "method does not exist" error
   - Currently commented out to prevent crashes
   - Needs investigation into proper timer method binding

2. **HTTP Request Handling**
   - API requests hang indefinitely
   - Possible issue with async handling or actor communication
   - May be related to how the DaprServer handles requests

3. **Actor Method Invocation**
   - Direct actor method calls timeout
   - Suggests issue with actor lifecycle or method routing
   - Could be related to how methods are bound in the wrapper pattern

### üîç Identified Issues

1. **Sidecar Communication**
   - Log shows "Awaiting Sidecar to be Started" message
   - This might indicate a timing issue with Dapr initialization

2. **Method Binding**
   - The wrapper pattern might not be properly binding methods
   - Actor methods might not be accessible through Dapr's reflection

3. **Async/Await Handling**
   - Possible promise resolution issues in the actor implementation
   - May need to review how async methods are exposed to Dapr

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Timer Registration**
   - Investigate proper timer registration syntax for Dapr actors
   - Ensure timer callback methods are properly bound

2. **Debug HTTP Request Flow**
   - Add more logging to trace where requests get stuck
   - Check if actor proxy creation is working correctly

3. **Review Actor Method Binding**
   - Ensure all actor methods are properly exposed to Dapr
   - Verify the wrapper pattern doesn't break Dapr's actor model

4. **Test Basic Actor Functionality**
   - Start with simple method calls without command execution
   - Gradually add complexity once basic calls work

## Technical Details

### Dependencies Successfully Injected
- `domainTypes` ‚úì
- `serviceProvider` ‚úì  
- `actorProxyFactory` ‚úì
- `serializationService` ‚úì
- `eventStore` ‚úì

### Actor Methods Available
- `executeCommandAsync` ‚úì
- `getAggregateStateAsync` ‚úì
- `saveStateCallbackAsync` ‚úì
- `saveStateAsync` ‚úì
- `rebuildStateAsync` ‚úì
- `receiveReminder` ‚úì
- `getPartitionInfoAsync` ‚úì
- `testMethod` ‚úì

## Conclusion

The Awilix DI implementation is successfully integrated at the structural level. The main issues appear to be related to runtime behavior, particularly around async operations and Dapr's actor communication model. The foundation is solid, but runtime issues need to be resolved for full functionality.
