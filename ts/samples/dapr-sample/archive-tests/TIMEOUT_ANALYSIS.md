# Timeout Analysis Results

## Issue Summary
The "timeout" problem was actually a **JSON parsing error**, not a timeout issue.

## Root Cause
The SekibanDaprExecutor expects the actor to return a JSON string, but the actor is returning an object. This causes the error:
```
"[object Object]" is not valid JSON
```

## Evidence from Debug Logs
1. **No timeout occurred**: Actor responses were very fast (7-22ms)
2. **HTTP calls succeeded**: All actor calls returned 200 status
3. **Actor executed successfully**: The actor method ran and completed
4. **JSON parsing failed**: The executor tried to parse an object as JSON

## Call Flow
1. API endpoint receives POST request
2. SekibanDaprExecutor calls actor via HTTP
3. Actor executes successfully (200 response)
4. SekibanDaprExecutor tries to parse response as JSON
5. **ERROR**: Response is already an object, not a JSON string

## Solution
Fix the JSON parsing logic in SekibanDaprExecutor to handle both:
- JSON strings (that need parsing)
- Objects (that don't need parsing)

## Code Location
The issue is in `/ts/src/packages/dapr/src/executor/sekiban-dapr-executor.ts` at line 201:
```typescript
const response = JSON.parse(responseStr);
```

This should be:
```typescript
const response = typeof responseStr === 'string' ? JSON.parse(responseStr) : responseStr;
```

## Key Insight
The timeout issue was a symptom of the JSON parsing error causing the executor to fail, not an actual network timeout. The ActorProxyBuilder approach suggested earlier would have also fixed this because it doesn't rely on the same JSON parsing logic.
