 * 1. Register actor types with Dapr
 * 2. Set up actor state management
 * 3. Configure actor reminders/timers if needed

/**
 * Information about Dapr Actor Integration
 * 
 * In the C# Sekiban implementation, actors are used to:
 * 1. Manage aggregate state
 * 2. Process commands atomically
 * 3. Handle concurrent access to aggregates
 * 4. Provide location transparency
 * 
 * The TypeScript implementation communicates with these actors
 * through the Dapr sidecar using the SekibanDaprExecutor.
