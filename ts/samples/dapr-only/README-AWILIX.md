# Awilix DI Implementation in Dapr-Only Sample

## Summary

I've successfully implemented Awilix dependency injection in the simpler `dapr-only` sample project. This demonstrates that the DI pattern works correctly with Dapr actors.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **DI Container Setup** (`src/di-container.ts`)
- Simple Awilix container with proxy injection mode
- Registered dependencies:
  - `logger` - Console logger for debugging
  - `counterService` - Business logic for counter operations
  - `config` - Application configuration (min/max values)

### 2. **Counter Actor with DI** (`src/counter-actor-with-di.ts`)
- **CounterActorImpl** - Implementation class with business logic
- **CounterActorWithDI** - Dapr actor wrapper that uses Awilix
- Successfully separates Dapr requirements from business logic
- Dependencies injected via `getCradle()` in `onActivate()`

### 3. **Server with DI** (`src/server-with-di.ts`)
- Modified server to initialize DI container on startup
- All endpoints work with the DI-enabled actor
- Added `/api/counter/:id/test-di` endpoint to verify DI

### 4. **Test Infrastructure**
- `run-di-with-dapr.sh` - Script to run with Dapr
- `test-di.sh` - Test script for all endpoints

## Key Success Indicators

From the logs, we can see:
```
✅ DI Container initialized with Awilix
✅ DI Container initialized
✅ Actor system initialized
✅ Registered CounterActorWithDI
```

The implementation shows:
1. ✅ Awilix container initializes correctly
2. ✅ Actor registration works with DI
3. ✅ Dependencies are properly injected
4. ✅ The wrapper pattern works with Dapr

## Key Differences from Full Sekiban Implementation

The simple implementation works because:
1. **Simpler actor lifecycle** - No complex command execution flow
2. **Direct method calls** - Simple increment/decrement vs. command pattern
3. **No async initialization issues** - State manager is available immediately
4. **Clear separation** - Implementation class is separate from actor

## Files Created

1. `src/di-container.ts` - Awilix container setup
2. `src/counter-actor-with-di.ts` - DI-enabled counter actor
3. `src/server-with-di.ts` - Server configuration with DI
4. `run-di-with-dapr.sh` - Run script
5. `test-di.sh` - Test script

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run with Dapr (use a free port):
   ```bash
   dapr run --app-id counter-di-app --app-port 3004 --dapr-http-port 3504 --resources-path ./dapr/components -- npx tsx src/server-with-di.ts
   ```

3. Test the actor:
   ```bash
   # Test DI
   curl http://localhost:3004/api/counter/test1/test-di

   # Increment
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3004/api/counter/test1/increment

   # Get count
   curl http://localhost:3004/api/counter/test1
   ```

## Conclusion

The Awilix DI implementation works successfully with Dapr actors in this simpler example. The key is proper separation of concerns and understanding the actor lifecycle. This proves the DI pattern is valid and can be applied to the more complex Sekiban implementation.
