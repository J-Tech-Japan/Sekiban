## Planned Phases (11-20) ðŸ“‹

### Immediate Priority (Phases 11-13)
- **Phase 11**: Persistent Storage Implementation âœ…
  - PostgreSQL with connection pooling, transactions, JSONB âœ…
  - CosmosDB with partition optimization, change feed âœ…
  - Storage migration tools âœ…
  - Configuration system for runtime storage provider selection âœ…
  
  **ChatGPT Consultation Key Points**:
  - PostgreSQL: Single table with JSONB (aggregate_id, seq, event_type, payload, meta, ts)
  - Primary key (aggregate_id, seq) for optimistic concurrency control
  - Use Kysely or Drizzle ORM for type-safe query builders
  - Batch writes with INSERT VALUES for 10-250 events per batch
  - Testcontainers for integration testing with real databases
  - Contract tests to ensure storage provider parity
  - Runtime storage provider selection via environment variables
  
  **Phase 11 Implementation Summary**:
  - Created @sekiban/postgres package with full PostgreSQL event store (15 tests)
  - Created @sekiban/cosmos package with CosmosDB support (4 mock tests)
  - Created @sekiban/testing package with storage contract tests (9 scenarios)
  - Created @sekiban/migration package with upcasters and CLI (26 tests)
  - Created @sekiban/config package with Zod validation (37 tests)
  - Total Phase 11 tests: 91 passing
  
- **Phase 12**: Snapshot Management
  - Configurable snapshot strategies
  - Compression and storage optimization
  - Performance improvements
  
- **Phase 13**: Event Versioning & Schema Evolution
  - Schema registry
  - Upcasting/downcasting
  - Migration tools

### Short-term Goals (Phases 14-16)
- **Phase 14**: Testing Framework & DevEx Tools
  - Test utilities and helpers
  - Debugging tools
  - Developer templates and CLI
  
- **Phase 15**: Process Managers & Sagas
  - Long-running process coordination
  - Saga orchestration
  - Workflow integration
  
- **Phase 16**: Monitoring & Observability
  - Metrics collection
  - Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)
  - Health checks and alerts

### Medium-term Goals (Phases 17-19)
- **Phase 17**: Multi-tenancy & Security
  - Tenant isolation
  - Encryption and security features
  - Compliance tools (GDPR)
  
- **Phase 18**: Integration & Messaging
  - Message bus integration (Kafka/RabbitMQ)
  - REST/GraphQL APIs
  - External system connectors
  
- **Phase 19**: Performance & Scalability
  - Batch processing optimization
  - Horizontal scaling
  - Advanced caching strategies

### Final Polish (Phase 20)
- **Phase 20**: Production Readiness
  - Zero-downtime deployment
  - Comprehensive documentation
  - Community and ecosystem building

## Key Achievements So Far

1. **Complete Event Sourcing Foundation**: All core components for event sourcing are implemented
2. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper typing throughout
3. **TDD Approach**: Every component built using Red-Green-Refactor cycle
4. **Extensible Architecture**: Storage providers, projectors, and executors are pluggable
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with Result pattern (neverthrow)

## Next Steps

The immediate focus should be on Phase 11 (Persistent Storage) as it's critical for production use. The PostgreSQL and CosmosDB implementations will enable real-world applications to use Sekiban for event sourcing.

## Technical Debt & Considerations

1. Some tests in the codebase are failing due to outdated imports/exports
2. The in-memory implementations need to be optimized for larger datasets
3. Documentation needs to be expanded with more real-world examples
4. Performance benchmarks should be established as a baseline

## Success Metrics

- 324 tests passing across 10 phases
- Clean separation of concerns
- Extensible architecture ready for production features
- Strong foundation for enterprise event sourcing applications
