# Sekiban.Pure.Dapr Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented Dapr support for Sekiban following the Orleans pattern with separate event handler and projector actors.

## Architecture Improvements

### 1. Separate Event Handler and Projector Actors
Following the improvement request in improvement1.md, the implementation now mirrors the Orleans architecture:

- **IAggregateEventHandlerActor/AggregateEventHandlerActor**: Handles event persistence and retrieval
- **IAggregateActor/AggregateActor**: Handles command execution and aggregate projection

This separation of concerns provides:
- Better scalability - event handling and projection can scale independently
- Clearer responsibilities - event persistence is separated from business logic
- Consistency with Orleans implementation

### 2. Key Components Implemented

#### Actors
- `AggregateEventHandlerActor`: Manages event storage with optimistic concurrency control
- `AggregateActor`: Executes commands and maintains aggregate state
- `MultiProjectorActor`: Placeholder for cross-aggregate projections

#### Infrastructure
- `SekibanDaprExecutor`: Main executor implementing ISekibanExecutor
- `DaprEventStore`: Repository implementation with IEventWriter and IEventReader
- `DaprRepository`: Bridges between actors for event sourcing operations

#### Supporting Classes
- `PartitionKeysAndProjector`: Manages partition keys and projector information
- `DaprSerializableAggregate`: State serialization for Dapr actors
- `EventExtensions`: Helper methods for event processing

### 3. Sample Implementation
Created a complete sample in `internalUsages/DaprSample` with:
- User aggregate with commands (CreateUser, UpdateUserName, UpdateUserEmail)
- RESTful API endpoints
- .NET Aspire integration
- Proper Dapr configuration

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Actor Pattern**: Used Dapr actors as a direct replacement for Orleans grains
2. **State Management**: Implemented actor state persistence with serializable aggregates
3. **Event Storage**: Created a hybrid approach using in-memory storage with Dapr state store persistence
4. **Concurrency Control**: Implemented optimistic concurrency checking in event append operations
5. **Timer-based State Saving**: Added periodic state persistence to optimize performance

## Integration Points

1. **Service Registration**: Extended IServiceCollection with AddSekibanWithDapr
2. **Actor Registration**: All actors are properly registered with Dapr runtime
3. **Event Serialization**: Integrated with Sekiban's existing serialization infrastructure
4. **Command Handling**: Maintains compatibility with Sekiban's command handler pattern

## Testing Considerations

The implementation is ready for:
- Unit testing with in-memory Dapr actors
- Integration testing with Dapr sidecar
- Performance testing to compare with Orleans implementation

## Next Steps

1. Implement production-ready event storage using Dapr state queries
2. Add support for event subscriptions and projections
3. Implement snapshot support for large event streams
4. Add comprehensive error handling and retry policies
5. Create performance benchmarks comparing Dapr vs Orleans implementations
