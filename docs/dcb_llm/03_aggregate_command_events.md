DCB replaces the aggregate-centric vocabulary with a tag-centric one. Commands still describe the user intent, but they
produce a single event that targets multiple tags. Projectors rebuild tag state per tag instead of per aggregate.

## Commands

Implement commands as records with validation attributes and a static handler. The handler receives an
`ICommandContext`, which exposes tag state queries, optimistic concurrency helpers, and event append helpers.

```csharp
public record CreateStudent : ICommandWithHandler<CreateStudent>
{
    [Required] public Guid StudentId { get; init; }
    [Required] public string Name { get; init; } = default!;
    [Range(1, 10)] public int MaxClassCount { get; init; } = 5;

    public static Task<ResultBox<EventOrNone>> HandleAsync(CreateStudent command, ICommandContext context) =>
        ResultBox.Start
            .Remap(_ => new StudentTag(command.StudentId))
            .Combine(context.TagExistsAsync)
            .Verify((_, exists) => exists
                ? ExceptionOrNone.FromException(new ApplicationException("Student Already Exists"))
                : ExceptionOrNone.None)
            .Conveyor((tag, _) => EventOrNone.EventWithTags(
                new StudentCreated(command.StudentId, command.Name, command.MaxClassCount),
                tag));
}
// Source: internalUsages/Dcb.Domain/Student/CreateStudent.cs
```

## Event Payloads

Events are immutable records implementing `IEventPayload`. Each command returns exactly one payload representing the full
business fact. For shared operations (e.g., enrollment) the event references every participant.

```csharp
public record StudentEnrolledInClassRoom(Guid StudentId, Guid ClassRoomId) : IEventPayload;
// Source: internalUsages/Dcb.Domain/Enrollment/StudentEnrolledInClassRoom.cs
```

## Tags

Tags describe which entities the event touches. They implement `ITag` or helper interfaces like `IGuidTagGroup<T>` that
provide consistent formatting. Tags can opt-in to reservation by returning `true` from `IsConsistencyTag()`.

```csharp
public record StudentTag(Guid StudentId) : IGuidTagGroup<StudentTag>
{
    public bool IsConsistencyTag() => true;
    public static string TagGroupName => "Student";
    public static StudentTag FromContent(string content) => new(Guid.Parse(content));
    public Guid GetId() => StudentId;
}
// Source: internalUsages/Dcb.Domain/Student/StudentTag.cs
```

Use helper tags for secondary dimensions. In the sample domain `YearlyStudentsTag` aggregates statistics by year but
returns `false` for `IsConsistencyTag()` so it never blocks writes.

## Tag State Payloads

Projectors rebuild tag state into `ITagStatePayload` records. Keep them small and immutable.

```csharp
[GenerateSerializer]
public record StudentState(Guid StudentId, string Name, int MaxClassCount, List<Guid> EnrolledClassRoomIds)
    : ITagStatePayload
{
    public int GetRemaining() => MaxClassCount - EnrolledClassRoomIds.Count;
}
// Source: internalUsages/Dcb.Domain/Student/StudentState.cs
```

## Tag Projectors

Tag projectors are static classes that implement `ITagProjector<T>`. They receive the current payload (or
`EmptyTagStatePayload`) and the incoming event. Always return the new payload without mutating shared state.

```csharp
public class StudentProjector : ITagProjector<StudentProjector>
{
    public static string ProjectorVersion => "1.0.0";
    public static string ProjectorName => nameof(StudentProjector);

    public static ITagStatePayload Project(ITagStatePayload current, Event ev) => (current, ev.Payload) switch
    {
        (EmptyTagStatePayload, StudentCreated created) => new StudentState(
            created.StudentId,
            created.Name,
            created.MaxClassCount,
            new List<Guid>()),

        (StudentState state, StudentEnrolledInClassRoom enrolled) when state.GetRemaining() > 0 => state with
        {
            EnrolledClassRoomIds = state.EnrolledClassRoomIds
                .Concat(new[] { enrolled.ClassRoomId })
                .Distinct()
                .ToList()
        },

        (StudentState state, StudentDroppedFromClassRoom dropped) => state with
        {
            EnrolledClassRoomIds = state.EnrolledClassRoomIds
                .Where(id => id != dropped.ClassRoomId)
                .ToList()
        },

        _ => current
    };
}
// Source: internalUsages/Dcb.Domain/Student/StudentProjector.cs
```

Projector versioning lets you force a rebuild when the projection logic changes. Actors compare the version string before
reusing cached state.

## Multi-Tag Commands

Commands that span multiple tags combine states before emitting the business fact. The executor automatically merges tags
from the returned `EventOrNone` plus any additional events appended in the context.

```csharp
public class EnrollStudentInClassRoomHandler : ICommandHandler<EnrollStudentInClassRoom>
{
    public static Task<ResultBox<EventOrNone>> HandleAsync(EnrollStudentInClassRoom command, ICommandContext context) =>
        ResultBox.Start
            .Remap(_ => new StudentTag(command.StudentId))
            .Combine(context.GetStateAsync<StudentState, StudentProjector>)
            .Verify((_, studentState) => studentState.Payload.GetRemaining() <= 0
                ? ExceptionOrNone.FromException(new("Student has reached maximum class count"))
                : studentState.Payload.EnrolledClassRoomIds.Contains(command.ClassRoomId)
                    ? ExceptionOrNone.FromException(new("Student is already enrolled in this classroom"))
                    : ExceptionOrNone.None)
            .Remap((studentTag, _) => TwoValues.FromValues(studentTag, new ClassRoomTag(command.ClassRoomId)))
            .Combine((_, classRoomTag) => context.GetStateAsync<ClassRoomProjector>(classRoomTag))
            .Verify((_, _, classRoomState) => classRoomState.Payload switch
            {
                AvailableClassRoomState available when available.GetRemaining() <= 0 =>
                    ExceptionOrNone.FromException(new("ClassRoom is full")),
                AvailableClassRoomState available when available.EnrolledStudentIds.Contains(command.StudentId) =>
                    ExceptionOrNone.FromException(new("Student is already enrolled in this classroom")),
                FilledClassRoomState => ExceptionOrNone.FromException(new("ClassRoom is full")),
                _ => ExceptionOrNone.None
            })
            .Conveyor((studentTag, classRoomTag, _) => EventOrNone.EventWithTags(
                new StudentEnrolledInClassRoom(command.StudentId, command.ClassRoomId),
                studentTag,
                classRoomTag));
}
// Source: internalUsages/Dcb.Domain/Enrollment/EnrollStudentInClassRoomHandler.cs
```

## Tips

- Use helper classes such as `ConsistencyTag` when you need to carry a known `SortableUniqueId` across retries.
- Prefer small, focused tag payloads. Move aggregations into MultiProjection so TagState actors stay lean.
- Commands should never mutate state directlyâ€”always delegate to events recorded through the executor.
